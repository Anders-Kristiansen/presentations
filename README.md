Structure:

 Folder names: kebab-case

* **Yearly Folders (`/2023`, `/2022`, etc.)** : Organize your presentations by year to make it easier to find presentations based on when they were given.
* **Monthly Subfolders (`/01-January`, `/02-February`, etc.)** : Within each year, organize presentations by the month they were given. This helps in narrowing down to a specific timeframe.
* **Topic Folders (`/TopicName`)** : Inside each month, group presentations by topic. This is useful if you cover multiple subjects in the same timeframe.
* **Presentation Files (`PresentationTitle_Date.pptx`)** : Name your presentation files with a clear title and date. This makes it easy to identify the content and context of each presentation.
* **README.md (optional)** : Include a Markdown file with a summary of the presentation, key takeaways, and any additional resources or links. This is helpful for providing context and further reading.
* **Resources Folder (`/resources`)** : If you have images, videos, or other media that are reused across multiple presentations, consider having a shared resources folder.
* **Templates Folder (`/templates`)** : Store any presentation templates here for consistency in future presentations.
* **Archive Folder (`/archive`)** : Older or less relevant presentations can be moved to an archive folder to keep the main directory clean and focused on current content.
